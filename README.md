# Thesis
Education is a cornerstone to the modern society. One of the steps involved in the process of education is college. Nowadays, a degree in a college is almost a necessity for many jobs. To succeed in future career, students need to pick the right college that matches their preferences to spend about 4 years of their life in. Hence, it is important to look at the nationally accumulated data on Colleges to ultimately help students pick their preferred colleges.

We will be observing the data on such colleges and present it in a helpful way for the users to understand. The source that we will be using comes from the source Data.gov, the link to which has been provided below. The data is collected, managed and hosted by the U.S. General Services Administration, Technology Transformation Service.

We aim to make use of specific subsets of the 2014-2015 data set. This data set will help us relate the different requirements of different schools throughout the nation and also provide us with information like top 75 percentile admit SAT score, acceptance rate, city of the respective university, tuition fees, etc.

# Target Audience
The major audience that we hope to aim are the graduating high school seniors who will be looking at different colleges to apply to. There dire need to compare the 75/25 percentile of each college to their own scores, tuition fee of each university and suitable city will be fulfilled by this data representation.

For example, John Wick, an average american high school senior who has bagged a decent score in SAT, limited financial standing and now wants to apply in different colleges. Since he cannot apply to all of the colleges (due to high application fee), John has to finalize few colleges where he thinks he can get in and where his other requirements are met. He turns to the information provided by us and he can easily list down universities according to his needs.

Another audience that we can target will be the high school counselors who need to keep a track of each university, their requirements, tuition fee etc., so that they can be helpful towards their students seeking guidance.

For example, Josh Spencer, a counselor at a public school, would need to consider the academic, financial and vocational situations of each of the student to suggest appropriate schools. Our presentation can assist people like Josh to consider preferable options for their students based on our easily understandable data and their experience.
